# Platinum3D-Game-Engine
World's Fastest and Simplest-To-Use Game Engine (TO BE)

Current Version: V0.1.0

Current version will feature:
* OpenGL based. (This hits at future game engine platform independence, it is currently built on Windows Desktop)
* A basic editor UI. This will be functioning once we have an input api and basic 2d graphics api.
* Multi-threading system. This will allow the engine to use the full potential of your computer's hardware (Especially for matrix, quaternion, and vector calculations), making for a faster game granted your hardware has more than one core. If this isn't the case, the engine will find bottlenecks and unimportant details in your game and disable, eliminate or otherwise limit them.
* This feature will provide the basis on which everything else will be added to.
