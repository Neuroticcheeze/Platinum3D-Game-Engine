# Platinum3D-Game-Engine
World's Fastest and Simplest-To-Use Game Engine (TO BE)

Current Version: V0.1.0

Current version will feature:
* A basic editor UI. This will be functioning once we have an input api and basic 2d graphics api.
* Parallel computation system. This will allow the engine to use the full potential of your computer's hardware, making for a faster game granted your hardware has more than one core. If this isn't the case, the engine will be smart enough to find bottlenecks and ethereal features in your game and limit them.
* This feature will provide the basis on which everything else will be added to.
